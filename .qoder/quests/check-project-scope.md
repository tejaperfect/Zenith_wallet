## Business Logic Layer

### Expense Splitting Engine
The system implements advanced splitting algorithms:

#### Equal Split
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Total Amount] --> B[Participant Count]
    B --> C[Amount Ã· Participants]
    C --> D[Individual Share]
```

#### Percentage Split
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Total Amount] --> B[User Percentage %]
    B --> C[Amount Ã— Percentage Ã· 100]
    C --> D[User Share]
```

#### Custom Split
- Manual amount assignment per participant
- Validation ensures total equals expense amount
- Percentage auto-calculation for transparency

#### Shares Split
- Weight-based distribution system
- Proportional calculation based on share ratios

### Settlement Algorithm
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Group Expenses] --> B[Calculate Balances]
    B --> C{Who Owes Whom?}
    C --> D[Optimize Settlements]
    D --> E[Generate Settlement Plan]
    E --> F[Track Settlement Status]
```

### Group Balance Calculation
1. **Total Paid**: Sum of all expenses paid by user
2. **Total Owed**: Sum of user's share in all group expenses
3. **Net Balance**: totalPaid - totalOwed
4. **Settlement Status**: Tracks partial and complete settlements
